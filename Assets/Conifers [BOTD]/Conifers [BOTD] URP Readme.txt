### Getting Started

In order to use the trees along with URP you have to install the "Conifers [BOTD] URP.unitypackage".
This will add URP compatible (URP 7.3.1. / 7.5.1) CTI shaders (at root level), tweaked materials and billboards and new prefabs for URP.
You do not need the folder "Built-in RP" but have to keep the "Shared Sources" of course.

In case you use a higher version of URP you may have to install one of the provided "CTI_URP_XXXX_runtime" packages afterwards.
