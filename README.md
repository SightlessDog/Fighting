## The Game

Two players can play against each other.

Features include

- **Split Screen** 
  - Screen is split in half so both players can play from their own perspective.
- **Health Bar**
  - Empties with every punch. When the Health Bar is empty the player loses the Game.
- **Stamina Bar**
  - The Stamina bar empties when the player moves. If it's empty the player can not act and has to wait for it to re-fill.
- **Input System**
- **Sound Effects**
  - You can get in the mood when Rocky's Theme Music starts playing on the main menu. While playing, the soft breeze of wind is surrounding you and is only disturbed by the sounds of pain and effort when the players move and hit.
- **Stunning Visuals**
